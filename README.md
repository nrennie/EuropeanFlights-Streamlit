# European Flights

This repository contains the code for a Streamlit app to display data on European flights from [Eurocontrol](https://ansperformance.eu/data/), via the [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) repository.

The app is deployed at [nrennie-europeanflights-streamlit-app-pdfow5.streamlit.app](https://nrennie-europeanflights-streamlit-app-pdfow5.streamlit.app/).

A Shiny (R) version of the same app is deployed at [nrennie35.shinyapps.io/EuropeanFlights](https://nrennie35.shinyapps.io/EuropeanFlights/). A Shiny (Python) version of the same app is deployed at [nrennie.github.io/EuropeanFlights-Python](https://nrennie.github.io/EuropeanFlights-Python/).
